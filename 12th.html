    <!-- Some tips while defining a color class:-
         Do not directly use the name of the color as the class name instead use 
         1.colorprimary 
         2.colorsuccess
         3.colorwarning -->
    <style>
        .bgprimary {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
    <!-- But if you like any change made in the developer tools, you can do the same in original file in VS code and refresh the page. That particular change will now reflect back permanently. Inspect Element allows us to make and view the changes in any of the websites present all over the world
    I have explained that how these changes are only reflecting on your local server. When you will reload that page again, all the things will set back to their default set up. In this way, you can use the developer tools of chrome.  -->
